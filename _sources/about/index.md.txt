# About the Metrics Operator

We have vision for a future where the cloud and high performance computing communities
are working together, and learning from one another to build new technologies that combine
the best of both worlds. This work started with the [Flux Operator](https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-operator)
and continues here with the Metrics Operator. With this project, we have two aims:

1. To make it easy to collect or or more metrics for an application of interest.
2. To provide a set of high performance computing apps that are traditionally used

By providing both metrics and applications, we are hoping to make it easier to communicate about
the needs of high performance computing in the cloud space. And of course we love Kubernetes
and all things containers, so it's a win win! This project is early in development, so we hope
you come back later to check it out. In the meantime, if you have any questions, please [let us know](https://github.com/converged-computing/metrics-operator/issues)
