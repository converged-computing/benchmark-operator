# Metrics Operator

Welcome to the metrics operator! We are having some fun designing a way to measure things in Kubernetes,
because that doesn't seem easy enough to do. In the meantime,
we are keeping notes here:

 - [Metrics](metrics.md): we have planned to implement
 - [Design](design.md): early design thinking
 - [Development](development.md): notes for developers

Come back later as we work on this project!
