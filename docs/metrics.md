# Metrics

The following metrics are under development (or being planned). These will be easier to add once I have
the basic infrastructure for the different types!

## Performance

 - *perf-sysstat*: the "pidstat" executable of the sysstat library.

## Storage

TBA

## To Be Added

#### Sysstat

Sysstat is stored as a general metrics analyzer, as it provides several different metric types;
It generally provides utils to monitor system performance and usage, including:

- *iostat* reports CPU statistics and input/output statistics for block devices and partitions.
- *mpstat* reports individual or combined processor related statistics.
- *pidstat* reports statistics for Linux tasks (processes) : I/O, CPU, memory, etc.
- *tapestat* reports statistics for tape drives connected to the system.
- *cifsiostat* reports CIFS statistics.
