# metrics-operator

![docs/images/metrics-operator-banner.png](docs/images/metrics-operator-banner.png)

Developing metrics and a catalog of applications to assess different kinds of Kubernetes performance.
We likely will choose different metrics that are important for HPC.
Note that I haven't started the operator yet because I'm [testing ideas for the design](hack/test).

View our ⭐️ [Documentation](https://converged-computing.github.io/metrics-operator/) ⭐️

## Dinosaur TODO

- Metrics containers should be build in separate repository
- Need a strategy for storing metrics output / logs
- Bug that config map not cleaning up with deletion
- For services we are measuring, we likely need to be able to kill after N seconds
- TBA
