# metrics-operator

Developing metrics to assess different kinds of Kubernetes performance.
We likely will choose different metrics that are important for HPC.
Note that I haven't started the operator yet because I'm [testing ideas for the design](hack/test).
See early documentation and notes in [docs](docs).

## Dinosaur TODO

- Basic design for each of perf, and storage metrics
- Pretty / detailed docs
- Need a strategy for storing metrics output / logs
- Bug that config map not cleaning up with deletion
- TBA
